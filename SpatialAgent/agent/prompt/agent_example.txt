You are given several functions that operate on mask objects (like pallets, buffers, transporters, and shelves). These functions include:

CRITICAL: Each function has a STRICT argument count limit. You MUST provide EXACTLY the number of arguments specified. Do NOT add extra arguments.

dist(mask_1, mask_2): Returns the distance between two masks.
- Argument count: EXACTLY 2 arguments (mask_1, mask_2)
- Example: dist(pallet_0, buffer_1)

closest(mask_1, list_of_masks): Returns the ID of the closest mask to mask_1 among the provided masks.
- Argument count: EXACTLY 2 arguments (mask_1, list_of_masks)
- The second argument MUST be a list [mask_2, mask_3, ...], NOT individual masks
- Example: closest(buffer_1, [pallet_0, pallet_1, shelf_3])
- WRONG: closest(buffer_1, pallet_0, pallet_1, shelf_3)  ❌ Too many arguments!

is_left(mask_1, mask_2): Returns True if mask_1 is to the left of mask_2.
- Argument count: EXACTLY 2 arguments (mask_1, mask_2)
- Example: is_left(transporter_0, pallet_2)

is_right(mask_1, mask_2): Returns True if mask_1 is to the right of mask_2.
- Argument count: EXACTLY 2 arguments (mask_1, mask_2)
- Example: is_right(shelf_3, pallet_1)

inside(mask_1, list_of_masks): Counts how many of the given masks are inside mask_1.
- Argument count: EXACTLY 2 arguments (mask_1, list_of_masks)
- The second argument MUST be a list [mask_2, mask_3, ...], NOT individual masks
- Example: inside(buffer_1, [pallet_0, pallet_1, pallet_2])
- WRONG: inside(buffer_1, pallet_0, pallet_1, pallet_2)  ❌ Too many arguments!

most_right(list_of_masks): Returns the ID of the mask that is the rightmost among the given masks.
- Argument count: EXACTLY 1 argument (a list of masks)
- The argument MUST be a list [mask_1, mask_2, ...], NOT individual masks
- Example: most_right([pallet_0, pallet_1, transporter_0, shelf_3])
- WRONG: most_right(pallet_0, pallet_1, transporter_0, shelf_3)  ❌ Too many arguments!

most_left(list_of_masks): Returns the ID of the mask that is the leftmost among the given masks.
- Argument count: EXACTLY 1 argument (a list of masks)
- The argument MUST be a list [mask_1, mask_2, ...], NOT individual masks
- Example: most_left([pallet_0, pallet_1, transporter_0, shelf_3])
- WRONG: most_left(pallet_0, pallet_1, transporter_0, shelf_3)  ❌ Too many arguments!

middle(list_of_3_masks): Returns the ID of the mask that is in the middle of the three masks.
- Argument count: EXACTLY 1 argument (a list of EXACTLY 3 masks)
- The argument MUST be a list with EXACTLY 3 elements [mask_1, mask_2, mask_3]
- Example: middle([pallet_0, pallet_1, transporter_0])
- WRONG: middle(pallet_0, pallet_1, transporter_0)  ❌ Too many arguments!
- WRONG: middle([pallet_0, pallet_1])  ❌ Too few masks in list!

is_empty(list_of_masks): Returns a list of transporter IDs that are empty. Only provide transporter masks as input.
- Argument count: EXACTLY 1 argument (a list of masks)
- The argument MUST be a list [mask_1, mask_2, ...], NOT individual masks
- Example: is_empty([transporter_0, transporter_1, transporter_2])
- WRONG: is_empty(transporter_0, transporter_1, transporter_2)  ❌ Too many arguments!

<question>  
Solve this question and answer with the following format:  
<reasoning>  
put your reasoning here  
</reasoning>  
then, choose one action between <execute> and <answer>  
<execute>  
Use one function here, I will return the results for you. After you receive the output from me, continue to the next iteration. Always start with the provided function name!
IMPORTANT: Always write a complete function call inside the execute tags with EXACTLY the correct number of arguments as specified above.
- Functions that require a list must receive ONE list argument: [mask1, mask2, ...]
- Do NOT pass multiple individual arguments when a list is required
For example:
<execute>most_right([buffer_0, buffer_1])</execute>
<execute>inside(buffer_1, [pallet_0, pallet_1, pallet_2])</execute>
<execute>dist(pallet_0, buffer_1)</execute>
</execute>  
or
<answer>  
only output the answer when you got the final answer.  
</answer>

IMPORTANT: After receiving a tool result, if you determine that the tool result is the final answer to the question, you can mark it by outputting <final> tag. For example:
Tool result: True
<final>
This indicates that the tool result (True) should be used as the final answer. For direction questions (is_left/is_right), the boolean result will be automatically converted to "left" or "right" direction string.  

Several important rules when solving the question:  
- CRITICAL: Always provide EXACTLY the number of arguments specified for each function. Functions that take a list must receive a SINGLE list argument, not multiple individual arguments.
- When asked to select or retrieve an object, please consider the distance.  
- Do not make any assumptions on objects' left/middle/right relationship based on their ID number—use the provided function to determine their left/middle/right position.  
- If you need to calculate multiple object distances, consider using the closest function.
- IMPORTANT: Always trust the function results. The functions analyze the actual spatial positions of objects in the image, not their names or IDs.
- When you receive a function result, use that exact result as your final answer without second-guessing or "correcting" it.
